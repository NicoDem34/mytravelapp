# Travel Planner AI

This project is a starting point for the Travel Planner AI application. It includes a minimal HTTP server implemented with Node.js. Run `npm start` to launch the server and see a welcome message.

```
npm install  # no dependencies yet
npm start
```

The server currently exposes a single endpoint at `/` returning a JSON greeting. Future development will expand this into a full-featured itinerary and document management system as described in the project specification.
